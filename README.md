## **Introduction**
Sea level rise is a critical challenge in coastal management and climate research. Traditional models often suffer from **high variance** and **bias** due to complex ocean dynamics. **This project applies ensemble learning to enhance prediction accuracy and stability.**  

### **Why Ensemble Learning?**
✅ Reduces model variance by combining multiple learners.  
✅ Improves robustness against overfitting.  
✅ Captures complex relationships between oceanographic variables.  

### **Project Objectives:**
🔹 Predict sea level variations using a data-driven approach.  
🔹 Implement **bagging, boosting, and stacking** ensemble methods.  
🔹 Optimize hyperparameters for **high predictive accuracy**.

### 🔍 **Feature Importance (SHAP Analysis)**  
![SHAP_summary](SHAP_summary.png)
The SHAP summary plot provides insights into the most influential features contributing to sea level changes:  

- **Upper Ocean Heat Content (`thetao_m3`)** has a strong positive impact on sea level rise. Higher heat content values correspond to higher SHAP values, indicating that increased ocean temperature significantly contributes to sea level changes.  
- **Upper Ocean Salt Content (`so_m3`)** also plays a crucial role. Lower salinity values often correspond to rising sea levels, likely due to freshwater input from melting ice or precipitation-driven dilution.  
- **Alongshore Ocean Currents (`V_eta`) and Cross-shore Ocean Currents (`V_xi`)** influence sea level variations by redistributing water masses across different regions.  
- **Alongshore Ekman Transport (`M_eta`) and Cross-shore Ekman Transport (`M_xi`)** drive large-scale water movement, impacting coastal sea level fluctuations.  
- **River Discharge (`dis24`)** affects local sea level anomalies, particularly in coastal zones, by altering freshwater input.  

These findings highlight that **Upper Ocean Heat Content and Upper Ocean Salt Content** are the dominant drivers in our model, with ocean currents and external forcing mechanisms adding further variability.  

📌 **Insights:**
- Stacking improves prediction accuracy over single models.
- SHAP analysis helps in identifying the most significant predictors.
